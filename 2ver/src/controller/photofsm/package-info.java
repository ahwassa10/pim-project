 * Holds the classes that implement the opening a photo in a separate display area.
 * The photo fsm allows the user to view the photo, re-caption it, remove it from
 * the collection, move/copy it to a new collection, apply a tag to the photo, and delete
 * a tag from the photo. Since the photo fsm runs in a separate window, multiple
 * photos can be viewed at the same time.
